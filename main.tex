\section{Scope of the book}

(sparse graphs, vertex coloring), target audience (PhD level,
familiarity with graph theory and basic coloring results expected, otherwise self-contained).

\section{Basic definitions and notation}

% claims: A, B, C, ... local
% labels: "lemma:zzz", "thm:zzz"
% numbered definitions only for important concepts

Notation for number of vertices/edges/faces of a graph $G$:
$|V(G)|$, $|E(G)|$, $|F(G)|$.  Use $n$ and $m$ for vertices and edges when repeated.

Colorings: $\varphi$, $\psi$, \ldots

$P_k$ denotes a path on $k$ vertices, its length is $k-1$.

$C_k$ denotes a cycle on $k$ vertices, its length is $k$.  Length of a cycle $C$ is denoted by $|C|$.

Girth (no special notation)?

Face of an embedded graph $G$ is a maximal connected subset of the surface minus $G$.
A face is \emph{$2$-cell} if it is homeomorphic to an open disk, \emph{closed $2$-cell}
if additionally bounded by a cycle.  Embedding is $2$-cell if all faces are $2$-cell.
\emph{Facial walk} of $f$ is a closed walk in $G$ tracing
a component of the boundary of $f$, the length $|f|$ of $f$ is the sum of lengths of its facial
walks.

Surfaces: $\Sigma$, $\Pi$; Euler genus $g(\Sigma)$.

Other notation (to be moved to where it becomes relevant).

critical for $k$-coloring/$k$-list-coloring

list chromatic number, $k$-list-colorable

If $G$ is $H$-critical,then $G\neq H$.

$\text{ch}_0$ for initial charge, $\text{ch}$ for final charge.  Discharging to non-negative.

\section{Overview of Results}

Note: How much overview here?

\part{Standard Methods}

Overview of Standard Methods (with examples and comments on common tricks and pitfalls):

Grotzch's theorem as a non-trivial motivating example

\chapter{Reducible Configurations and Discharging}

ZD

\section{Overview of the Method}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss Euler's formula
\item Proof of $5$-color theorem
\item Example: $3$-colorability with no 4 to 9 cycles
\item Comments on the choice of the initial charge, iteration between improving discharging rules and finding reducible configurations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Easy Examples?}

\begin{itemize}
\item (say from Cranston and West), e.g. $5/2$ coloring for planar graphs?
\item Rule values via linear programming, obstructions from dual solution. (What does this mean?)
\end{itemize}

\section{Trick: A Precolored Face}

Use precolored face to get rid of short cycles. Example: no $4$ to $7$ (or $8$?), $3$-coloring?

Pitfall: Vertices appearing more than once in a configuration.

ZD

\section{Overview of the Method}

\section{Bounding the Size of a Critical Graph}

Overview Methods to bound size of a critical graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reductions increasing a properly defined weight (example: linear bound on the size of graphs in disk
critical for $5$-coloring?).
\item Specific subgraphs at the precolored face coming from the nibbling method (example: quadratic (or linear?) bound
on the size of graphs in disk critical for $5$-list-coloring)?
